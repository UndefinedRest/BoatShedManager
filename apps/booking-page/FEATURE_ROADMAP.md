# BoatBooking Feature Roadmap

**⚠️ This document has been consolidated into the solution-wide roadmap.**

**See**: [docs/planning/roadmap.md](../docs/planning/roadmap.md)

---

## Rationale for Consolidation

To maintain a **single source of truth** for all feature development across the LMRC solution, all project-specific roadmaps have been consolidated into one solution-wide roadmap.

**Benefits**:
- Single place to view all features across all projects
- Easier cross-project prioritization
- Clear visibility of solution-wide development status
- Each feature clearly marked by project
